# DielectricSpheres

This repository implements existing methods for solving electric potential in systems consisting of dielectric spheres, ions, and equilibrium background charge.

We will first implement a 2D version based on the method described in [2D-paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0036139996297614). The 3D version will be implemented later following the approach in [3D-paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/15M105046X).

Subsequently, we will explore novel methods involving analytic continuation to extend the 3D approach.
